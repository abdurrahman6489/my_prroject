            <div id="content">Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
                receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at
                Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where
                he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City
                before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up
                laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His
                alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse
                Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase
                system which that company eventually marketed.

                Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
                mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
                wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
                demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
                showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and
                worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
                New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless
                communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished
                Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran
                out of funding before he could complete it.</div>
