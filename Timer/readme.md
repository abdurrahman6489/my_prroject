Timer App
This is a Timer App, where user gives a time to this Timer in the input box, presses Start Button and Timer starts, it stops after the time finishes

User can pause the Timer any number of times.
The Timer can also be reset
The button which is pressed is turned to green colour

There is a progressIndicator bar and progress in percent.
It remains in green colour in normal,
if time goes beyond 80%, it turns to orange
if time goes beyond 90%, it turns to red
indicating that time remaining is less.

suppose if user gives 70 in the seconds input, then it automatically adjusts time, showing 1 in minute input and 10 in seconds. so the user does not have to calculate all the time conversions.
